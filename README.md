# CG Project Black (Restless)

## Description

This is the final project for the Computer Graphics course. It is a 3D souls-like game made with Unity, temporarily titled "Restless".
This project can be considered a prototype for a bigger game that I'm planning on creating.

## Controls

You can play with keyboard and mouse but it is recommended to use a controller.

- Player movement: Left analog stick / WASD
- Camera movement: Right analog stick / Mouse
- Interact: X / A / Right click
- Jump: △ / Y / Space
- Duck: ○ / B / Shift
- Dodge: Press Duck button while moving (the dodge becomes a dash when locked-in, and a roll when not)
- Run: Hold Duck button
- Lock-in: R3 / RSB / Tab
- Light Attack: R1 / RB / Left click
- Heavy Attack: R2 / RT / Right click
- Charged Heavy Attack: Hold Heavy Attack button
